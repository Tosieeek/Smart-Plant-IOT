Smart-Plant is a small univeristy project. Main idea was to create something what can encourage students to interact during a pandemic of Covid-19. 
How it works?
Created Arduino system measures plant conditions. If conditions are poor program picks randomly two people from a previously-prepared list. Picked students should came to school together and improve conditions of the plant.
